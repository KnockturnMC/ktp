Subject: [PATCH] Create PreAPITeleportEvent

As spigot api teleportation is subject to stricter checks than the
default minecraft teleportation, some plugins may not be able to
teleport entities that would be perfectly fine teleporting under the
vanilla standart.

To not remove the created rules by spigot and potentially break plugin
compatibility the PreAPITeleportEvent is called prior to most checks
executed by spigot which allows plugins to modify potential target
entities that are teleported by other plugins prior to the checks.

+/**
+ * Defines an event thrown prior to any checks that may prevent an entity from being teleported through the server
+ * API. This event is therefore of use for pre-teleportation logic that may interfere with the checks.
+ * <p>
+ * As the event is therefore purely for monitoring purposes and modification of external causes for potential failures
+ * in the API teleportation, this event is not mutable and changes to the {@link PreAPITeleportEvent#getFrom()} as well
+ * as the {@link PreAPITeleportEvent#getTo()} location are not respected by the server.
+ * <p>
+ * The only checks that this event is not capable of bypassing is the {@link Location#checkFinite()} check that
+ * is assumed for every kind of teleportation as well as the {@link LivingEntity#isDead()} checks that are performed
+ * prior to teleportation as entities with 0 health or those that are marked dead may not be teleported.
+ * <p>
+ * Furthermore this event may be called in both async and sync mode as teleportation may occur in sync with the server
+ * and outside of the main server thread. If the event is in sync or not can be checked through
+ * {@link Event#isAsynchronous()}
