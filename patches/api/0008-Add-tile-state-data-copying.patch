Subject: [PATCH] Add tile state data copying

To allow plugins to clone tile states from one block to another, this
patch introduces a copy method on the tile state interface that enables
plugins to load the tile state data of an already existing tile state
into a second tile state, effectivly cloning the initial tile state.
