Subject: [PATCH] Add manual totem of undying resurrection API

This patch introduces new API methods to the living entity that allow
plugins to manually trigger a totem of undying resurrection on any given
living entity.

This is specifically useful for plugins that use the #setHealth methods
to manipulate the entities health.

The API is a full representation of the server internal and fully
simulates a resurrection including bukkit event calls and potion
effects.

+     * <ul>
+     *   <li>
+     *     This method will call the {@link org.bukkit.event.entity.EntityResurrectEvent} (which is called whether the entity has a totem or not in
+     *     their inventory. The event however will be pre-cancelled if the entity does not have an applicable totem).
+     *     The event itself is respected, hence a cancelled event will cancel all of the following side effects.
+     *   </li>
+     *   <li>
+     *     This method will set the entity's health to 1F (as if it just escaped death, no matter the current health)
+     *   </li>
+     *   <li>
+     *     This method will cleanse all potion effects currently on the entity and add the ones expected from a successful usage of the totem of
+     *     undying, if one was found.
+     *   </li>
+     *   <li>
+     *     This method will remove the totem of undying used if the entity had one that could be used.
+     *   </li>
+     * </ul>
+     *
+     * @return whether the entity was successfully resurrected using a totem of undying.
