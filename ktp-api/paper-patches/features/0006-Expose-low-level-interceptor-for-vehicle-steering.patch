Subject: [PATCH] Expose low level interceptor for vehicle steering

To allow plugins to run their own steering logic when a player is
steering an entity that, by vanilla's design choices, does not react to
vehicle movement packets, this patch introduces new API plugins can use
to handle these packets.

To keep the API as fast and lightweight as possible, the spigot event
bus was previously optimized and is now called off the main thread
before the packet even begins processing. While this obviously prevents
acceess to the world, it also allows intercepting events to prevent main
thread sync for these packets.
